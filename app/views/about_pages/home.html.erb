		<hr>
		<p> The India Cultural Association (ICA) is a non-profit organization dedicated to enhancing Indian Cultural Awareness in Portland, Oregon. The Association was established in 1980, and has since brought the entire Indian community together and provided a venue for a population of over 10,000 to reconnect with its roots.</p>
		<br>
		<p> ICA's claim to fame is its largest and most-loved event -- The India Festival. The festival is filled with the tastes, sights, and sounds of India - with live music, dance, food and entertainment thoughout the day! The festival brings over 8,000 visitors to Portland's Pioneer Square, and never fails to delight with its non-stop entertainment. </p>
		<br>
		<p>We at ICA are so thankful to the Portland community for making our organization what it is today. We hope to see you at this year's India Festival!</p>
