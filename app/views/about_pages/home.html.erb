		<hr>
		<p> The India Cultural Association (ICA) is a non-profit organization dedicated to enhancing Indian Cultural Awareness in Portland, Oregon. The Association was established in 1980, and has since brought the entire Indian community together and provided a venue for a population of over 10,000 to reconnect with its roots.</p>
		<br>
		<p> ICA's claim to fame is its largest and most-loved event -- The India Festival, a festival in honor of India's Independence Day. The festival brings over 8,000 visitors to Portland's Pioneer Square, and never fails to delight with live music, dance, food and entertainment thoughout the day! We truly believe that the festival encompasses the tastes, sights, and sounds of India</p>
		<br>
		<p>In addition, ICA hosts an annual Diwali festival, occassional tennis tournaments, and other events for the community. In order to stay in touch with ICA events and other upcoming events in the Portland Area, check-out our Facebook Page, or Contact Us to become a member and join the mailing list</p>
		<p>We at ICA are so thankful to the Portland community for making our organization what it is today. We hope to see you at this year's India Festival!</p>
